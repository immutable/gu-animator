# Immutable Games Animator

An animation framework that combines several libraries together (lottie / gsap / pixi / threejs). Ig-Animator helps to orchestrate syncing multiple animations from After Effects (exported via Bodymovin) and GLTF models in a 3D environment using threeJS.

1. `git clone git@github.com:immutable/ig-animator.git`
2. `cd ig-animator`
3. `nvm install && nvm use` (set expected node version)
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start`

## Building
